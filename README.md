## Introduction

**Sonko** is a mini JavaScript framework based on the concept of Virtual DOM. The main objective is to explore and understand the foundations of frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular by implementing key features such as:

- Creating a Virtual DOM
- Synchronizing the Virtual DOM with the real DOM
- Managing state and events

This experience has allowed me to discover what happens under the hood of frameworks and better understand their functionality. As a result, I can now easily grasp any JavaScript framework or library.

## Installation

To install Sonko via npm:

```bash
npm install sonko
