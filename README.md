## Introduction

**Sonko** is a mini JavaScript framework based on the concept of Virtual DOM. The main objective is to explore and understand the foundations of frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular by implementing key features such as:

- Creating a Virtual DOM
- Synchronizing the Virtual DOM with the real DOM
- Managing state and events

This experience has allowed me to discover what happens under the hood of frameworks and better understand their functionality. As a result, I can now easily grasp any JavaScript framework or library.

## Installation

To install Sonko via npm:

```bash
npm install sonko
```

Or clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mirak29/sonko.git
```
```bash

```

## Features
- createElement(type, props, ...children): Creates a VDOM element.
- render(vdom, container): Renders the VDOM to the real DOM.
- Component: Base class to create components

## Conclusion
This project allowed me to delve into the internal mechanics of modern frameworks, giving me the confidence to easily master any JavaScript framework or library.
